      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
      <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example: </p>
      <li>
        <ul>
          Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
        </ul></li>

        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
        <li><ul>
          A general understanding of the internet and the World Wide Web.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language(HTML).
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.
        </ul></li>

        <header id="Hello_world">Hello world
        </header>
        <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code: </p>
        <code>function greetMe(yourName) {alert("Helllo" + yourName);}
          greetMe("World");</code>
          <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section">
          <header id="Variables">
          </header>
          <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules. </p>
          <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase). </p>
          <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name. </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section">
          <header id="Declaring_variables">Declaring variables
          </header>
          <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
          <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
          <code>var x = 42.</code>
          <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
          <p>By simply assigning it a value. FOr example,</p>
          <code>x = 42.</code>
          <p>This always declares a global variable. It generate a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
          <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
          <code>let y = 13.</code>
          <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See variable scope below.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section">
          <header id="Variable_scope">Variable scope
          </header>
          <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function. </p>
          <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement. </p>
          <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); //5</code>
          <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
          <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); //ReferenceError: y is not defined</code>

          <header id="Global_variables">Global variables
          </header>
          <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax. </p>
          <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber. </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section">
          <header id="Constants">Constants
          </header>
          <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters. </p>
          <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
          <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value. </p>
          <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable. </p>
          <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example: </p>
          <p> However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems. </p>
          <code>const myObject = {"key":"value"}; myObject.key = "otherValue";</code>
